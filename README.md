# dns camel
Goal is to get a place where we can gather DNS relevant RFCs and drafts,
including page numbers and number of 'MUST' and 'SHOULD' statements.

Page is live on https://powerdns.org/dns-camel/

## How you can help
In various ways:

 * The source file [dns-rfc-annotations.json] is known to not list all DNS relevant RFCs
 * Check if your favorite RFCs are listed in the right categories
